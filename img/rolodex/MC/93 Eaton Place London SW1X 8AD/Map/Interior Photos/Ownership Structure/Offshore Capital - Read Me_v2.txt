This artwork features a collection of images, 3D scans, screengrabs, and animations that focus on 93 Eaton Place, London SW1X 8AD. 

It is a property owned by a Russian oligarch on the UK sanctions list. It is currently owned through an offshore company, Valton Limited, registered in the tax haven of Bermuda. Due to a change in legislation the beneficial owners of offshore property owners are now able to be revealed through a public register operated by the British government. 

I have made a 3D scan of this property as part of my ongoing Offshore Capital project. For this exhibition I have gathered property ownership information, images, and photographs of the property and its owner from online public property information databases. This information is presented alongside visual material I have produced from the 3D scan I have made of the property.

You can explore the property and its owner by having a look through the following pages. Look for links to delve further into the project. The property is part of my 3D scanning project Offshore Capital that catalogues property in the UK owned by offshore companies located in tax havens. More information about the wider project at the online website (a link is included at the end of the following pages).
